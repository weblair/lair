## Contribution Guidelines

### Workflow
Before committing, be sure to:
 1. Use [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
 2. [Sign your commits](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)
 3. Run `gofmt -s -w .`

### Commit Messages
The rules of [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) should be observed.
Observe to keep the first line of the commit message down to 50 characters and insert hard line-breaks at 72 characters
for the rest of the message body.

When working on `feature` or `hotfix` branches, the rules can be relaxed a bit. PRs should only be opened from your 
`develop` branch, and when wrapping up your `feature` branches, you should squash your commits.

#### Tags
  - fix&mdash;for bugfixes
  - feat&mdash;for any new functionality
  - BREAKING CHANGE&mdash;annotation in the commit message body for any changes that will affect backwards-compatability.
  - refactor&mdash;for reworked code that ends up being functionally the same
  - docs&mdash;for changes to docstrings, CHANGELOG.md, this README, etc.
  - chore&mdash;for changes to the repo that don't affect functional code or
    docs (i.e. Makefiles, Dockerfiles, etc.)
